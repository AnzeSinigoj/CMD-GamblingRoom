# GamblingRoom

<mark>**WORK IN PROGRESS!**</mark>

This is a school project where we have to create a gambling game featuring dice and multiplayer options.

 The project is usually done in PHP, but I wrote it in JavaScript since it's just a game and doesn't require backend security.

It works on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to larger screens.

The theme was inspired by CMD colors and has a look similar to how hackers are portrayed in the media.

### Features:
- Multiplayer support
- Ability to change player name and color
- Automatic/manual dice throws
- Option to set the number of rounds per game
- Option to set the number of dice throws per round
